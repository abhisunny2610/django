# Django Project File Structure

A standard Django project consists of several directories and files. Here's an overview of the typical file structure:

- **project_name/**
  - **project_name/**
    - `settings.py` - Project settings and configurations.
    - `urls.py` - URL routing for the project.
    - `wsgi.py` - WSGI configuration for production.
    - `asgi.py` - ASGI configuration for asynchronous applications.
  - **apps/**
    - Individual Django applications (e.g., `app1/`, `app2/`).
  - **static/**
    - Static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
  - **templates/**
    - HTML templates used for rendering views.
- **media/**
  - User-uploaded media files (e.g., user-generated images).
- **venv/** (Virtual Environment - optional but recommended)
  - Python virtual environment for project dependencies.
- `manage.py` - Command-line utility for managing the project.
- `requirements.txt` - List of project dependencies for pip.
- `.gitignore` - Defines which files and directories to ignore in version control.
- `README.md` - Project documentation and information.
- `.env` - Environment variables (secret keys, API keys, etc.).
- `Procfile` - For Heroku deployment (optional).
- `.editorconfig` - Editor settings (optional).
- `Dockerfile` - Docker configuration (optional).
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration (optional).
- `LICENSE` - Project licensing information (optional).

### Django App File Structure

Inside each Django app directory, you'll typically find the following structure:

- `apps/`
  - **app_name/**
    - `admin.py` - Admin panel configuration.
    - `apps.py` - App-specific configuration.
    - `models.py` - Database models.
    - `views.py` - Views and request handling logic.
    - `urls.py` - URL routing for the app.
    - `forms.py` - Form classes for user input handling.
    - `tests.py` - Unit tests for the app.
    - **templates/app_name/**
      - App-specific HTML templates.
    - **static/app_name/**
      - App-specific static files.

This structure helps maintain a clean and organized codebase in Django projects. You can also add additional directories or files as needed based on your project's requirements. Always document your code and adhere to best practices for consistency and collaboration.
